Answer the questions posted in the instructions here.

Question 1:

(a)Seg Fault(core dumped)


(b)Line 30. fgets function

Problem 2: nextLine which is a pointer to an array of chars is not initialized. It is used to store a line read from filePtr.

Problem 3: calloc nextLine so that it is initialized before calling fgetline since fgetline calls fgets in the first time. calloc initialized buffer with zero while malloc do not initialize.
Both dynamically allocate space on heap.
